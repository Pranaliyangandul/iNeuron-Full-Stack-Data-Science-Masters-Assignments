    "Answer - Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class. \n",
    "The class that inherits from another class is called the derived class, subclass, or child class, and the class being inherited from is called the base class, superclass, or parent class.\n",
    "Inheritance is used to establish a hierarchical relationship between classes, where the derived class can access and reuse the attributes and methods defined in the base class. \n",
    "This enables code reuse, enhances code organization, and promotes the creation of a class hierarchy with specialized classes inheriting from more general classes."

    "Single Inheritance:\n",
    "    Single inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class can inherit properties and behaviors from only one base class. In other words, a derived class can have only one direct parent class. The derived class inherits all the attributes and methods of the base class and can extend its functionality by adding new attributes and methods or overriding existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Simplicity: Single inheritance leads to a simpler class hierarchy as each class has only one direct parent class. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Code Reusability: Single inheritance still allows code reuse since a class can inherit all the functionality of its parent class. This promotes a modular design and reduces code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Avoiding Ambiguity: With single inheritance, there are no conflicts or ambiguity in the inheritance chain. A method or attribute is unambiguously inherited from a single base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class can inherit properties and behaviors from more than one base class. In other words, a derived class can have multiple direct parent classes. The derived class inherits all the attributes and methods from all its base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit functionality from multiple base classes, promoting extensive code reuse. This is particularly useful when a class needs to combine features from different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Flexible Class Design: Multiple inheritance enables more flexible class design as a class can have multiple sources of functionality. This allows developers to build complex systems by composing functionalities from different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Polymorphism: Multiple inheritance plays a vital role in polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly when they share a common base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between Single and Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Number of Base Classes: The most apparent difference is that single inheritance allows a class to inherit from only one base class, while multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from multiple base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Ambiguity: In single inheritance, there is no ambiguity in the inheritance chain. In contrast, multiple inheritance may lead to ambiguity when the same method or attribute is inherited from multiple base classes. This situation is known as the \"diamond problem\" and requires resolution through method overriding or explicit method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Class Hierarchy: Single inheritance leads to a simpler class hierarchy, whereas multiple inheritance can result in a more complex class hierarchy due to the presence of multiple base classes."
